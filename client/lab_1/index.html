        <h1>Diego Amores Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Top 5 Favorite Albums.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If Only You Were Lonely by Hawthorne Heights</li>
            <li>Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park</li>

        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.</p>
        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
        <img src="images/mochi.gif" alt="A dancing mochi ball"/>
        <img src="images/mochi.jpg" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble"/>
        <img src="images/mochi.png" alt="A mochi ball"/>
        <img src="images/mochi.svg" width="150" alt="A mochi ball with BÃ©zier handles"/>
